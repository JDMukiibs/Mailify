Simple automated python script to send out multiple emails.
Helpful sites that I visited to make this work: 

1. https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides
2. https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-send-an-email-with-attachments-in-python-abe3b957ecf3

## Why?

This idea came to me as I was trying to figure out how I could send individual emails attached with my CV to some hiring managers listed in my university's register 
together with company names where students have previously carried out internships. I did this in hope of maybe trying to secure an internship interview or even
an internship for the summer of 2021. As of the time of writing, I don't know how much this will pan out but if you were looking for something like this, feel free
to use the source code and make your own version. 

I will probably be working on improving maybe add a user interface make it easier to use for less tech-savvy people. Happy to listen to any great ideas anyone has.

## How to make it work?

First follow the steps on https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python ,so you can get your personal credentials.json file which you should keep very carefully.
You could leave it after getting your .json file but then the first time you run this script you'll have to do the authorization part, so I recommend finishing up first with the steps given by Google.

After that, simply change the stuff you need to change as also commented out within the script. Then, run it the same way you run the quickstart.py. 

Happy Emailing.
